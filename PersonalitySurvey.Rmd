# Personality Study
This data was collected as part of a personality study conducted by my Advanced Statistics students.

The dataset is called Personality. The variables are described below,

* Extroverted: "How extroverted do you think you are?" (5-point scale)
* Introverted: "How introverted do you think you are?" (5-point scale)
* DomInt: "Are you an international or domestic student?"
* DayBoarding: "Are you a day or boarding student?"
* Sex: "Are you a male or female?"
* Zodiac: " What is your zodiac sign?"

```{r}
df = read.csv("PersonalitySurvey.csv")
summary(df)
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = df) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=Zodiac, y=Extroverted, col = Zodiac))+
  coord_flip()
  
```
